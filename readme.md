# Ergogen

This is my fork of [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen).

Ergogen is a keyboard generator that aims to provide a common configuration format to describe **ergonomic** 2D layouts, and generate automatic plates, cases, and (un-routed) PCBs for them.
The project grew out of (and is an integral part of) the [Absolem keyboard](https://zealot.hu/absolem), and shares its [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nbKcAZB) as well.

For usage and config information, please refer to the [docs](https://docs.ergogen.xyz).

## Usage

I use some components from Ben Vallack [Ergogen Fork](https://github.com/benvallack/ergogen). Use this app with [development usage](https://docs.ergogen.xyz/#development-usage) because of these components.

You can find my config in [lebeda.yaml](lebeda.yaml)
